# CrossTheRoad
A simple game where you must cross the road and avoid incoming traffic using OOP in C++. Displays my style of coding and the use of classes in separate files in a neat and organized way.

Console window updates freuently causing a flicker. The flicker increases with the amount  of content on screen. This will need to be fixed in the future.
